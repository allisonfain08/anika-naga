    <h1 class = "name"> anika naga </h1>
    <p class = "adjectives">athlete, actor, ambitious</p>
    <p class = "bleh"> anika is nice. she does things, unlike me. she is very athletic and an actor because that's super cool. woah. what a gal. honestly she rocks my socks off. she goes to Denmark High School (a new school) and is a rising sophomore. She wants to do something lucrative and make money like a good little capitalist. But for real, she's pretty cool and driven. she knows what she wants and she's not afraid to take risks to get it accomplished. </p>
